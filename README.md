# Recipe Application

## Overview
This is a recipe management application. It allows users to browse, filter, and view recipes.  
The app includes an admin interface for managing the recipes and their categories.

- **React**: The application is built using React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS for utility-based design. A first and probably a last for me!
